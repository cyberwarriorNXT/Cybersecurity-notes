1. What Is a Network? 

A network is a group of devices (computers, phones, routers, servers) connected together to share information.

Example:
Your phone → WiFi Router → Internet → Google Server → Google Website.

2. Why Networking Matters in Cybersecurity

You cannot secure something you don’t understand. <br>
<br>
Most cyber attacks happen through networks:
<ul>
<li>DDoS attacks</li>

<li> Port scanning</li>

<li>Packet sniffing
</li>

<li> Man-in-the-middle</li>

<li> SQL injection via HTTP </li>

<li> Malware communication</li>

</ul>

So, networking is the foundation for cybersecurity.

3. What is a protocol?

A set of rules for data communication between devices, or how data is sent or received.
<br>
Like traffic rules → cars
<br>
Protocols → data

Examples:

HTTP = web browsing

TCP = reliable communication

DNS = convert name to IP
